# New `ls`

This project is an attempt to write a simple `ls` command in Rust for practicing 
and building familiarity with the language. It uses the following packages:
1. `clap` (Command line argument parser)
2. `owo_color` (Colorize output to STDOUT)
3. `strum` (Macros for easing work with strings and enums)
4. `chrono` (Package to work with date and time)
5. `serde` (Serialize and Deserialize JSON)
6. `tabled` (Print tables in command-line)
